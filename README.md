This project demonstrates the use of grunt as your task builder.

minifying css and js.
combining css and js.
jshint for vaidating the js files.
Also I have used 'watch' for detecting the changes in the project and then run the tasks.

grunt plugins I have used in the project are

https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-contrib-watch
https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-contrib-uglify
https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-contrib-jshint
https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-contrib-cssmin
